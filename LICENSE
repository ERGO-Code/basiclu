BASICLU, Copyright (c) 2016-2020  ERGO-Code

BASICLU License: At the user's option, you may use BASICLU under either the GPL
version 3 license, or the MIT license. You may not use both licenses, nor may
you mix-and-match clauses from each license. To use a license, in the
documentation for your application simply state either of the following,
replacing <YOUR APPLICATION> with the name of your application:

    BASICLU Copyright (c) 2016-2020  ERGO-Code
    Used in <YOUR APPLICATION> under the MIT license.

or

    BASICLU Copyright (c) 2016-2020  ERGO-Code
    Used in <YOUR APPLICATION> under the GPL v3 license.

In the event that your package <A> includes another package <B> by another
author, and <A> and <B> use BASICLU under different licenses, you may select one
license to apply to both uses of BASICLU in the combined application.

The following files in the BASICLU package come from external sources and have
their own licenses:

example/mmio.c   [from http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/mmio-c.html]
example/mmio.h   [from http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/mmio-c.html]
