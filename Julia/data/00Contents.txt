This directory contains sequences of basis matrices from a dual simplex solver.
The linear programs were solved with CPLEX 12.7 starting from the slack basis
and using steepest edge pricing. Each .mat file contains

A       m-by-n LP matrix
B       final m-by-m basis matrix
invar   index that enters the basis in each iteration
outvar  index that leaves the basis in each iteration

The variables to columns of A are indexed 1 to n. The slack variables are
indexed n+1 to n+m. When invar(k)==outvar(k), then the iteration was a bound
flip and the basis matrix did not change.
